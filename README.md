## Development

### Code Quality

All scripts are checked with [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to ensure quality and best practices.

#### Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit hook is configured to automatically run ShellCheck on any modified shell scripts before committing. This prevents committing code with shellcheck issues.

The hook is located at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and will:
- Run automatically before each commit
- Check all staged `.sh` and `.bash` files
- Block the commit if any issues are found
- Require shellcheck to be installed locally

To bypass the hook (not recommended): `git commit --no-verify`

#### GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration is set up via GitHub Actions to run ShellCheck on:
- Every push to `main` or `master` branches
- Every pull request targeting `main` or `master` branches

The workflow configuration is in `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml`.
